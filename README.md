# Node.js CRUD Server with MongoDB

This repository, "serverbackend," contains a Node.js server that allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a MongoDB database. You can use Postman or any other API client to interact with the server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB server running locally or on a remote host.
- Postman or any other API client for testing the server endpoints.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/Nighthawk4709/serverbackend.git
   cd serverbackend
   npm install
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
   npm start

Your Node.js server should now be running and listening for incoming requests on a specified port (by default, it's port 8000).

##API Endpoints
GET /user/read: Retrieve all items from the MongoDB database.
GET /user/read:id: Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
POST /user/create: Create a new item.
PUT /user/update/:id: Update an existing item by its ID.
DELETE /user/delete:id: Delete an item by its ID.

You can use Postman or any other API client to send requests to these endpoints.
